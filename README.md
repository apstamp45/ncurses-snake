# Ncurses Snake
The classic game "Snake" written in C using the ncurses library.

# Intallation
&emsp;To install, clone the reposotory and run install.sh with root privelages (needed to move executable and to create the high score file).

# How to play
&emsp;Use either arrow keys or HJKL keys to guide the snake through the playing field. The goal of the game is to eat the apples (the red boxes) to get the snake as large as possible. The game ends when you either crash into yourself, or press Q to quit the game. The high score should be stored in a file at /etc/snake.hs .
