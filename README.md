# Ncurses Snake

The classic game "Snake" written in C using the ncurses library.

# Intallation

To install, clone the reposotory and run install.sh with root privelages (needed to move executable and to create the high score file).

# Known issues

When the game starts, random characters will sometimes appear (Hopefully fixed).
When the window is too small but no error is thrown, the border will be drawn incorrectly.
